I’ve wondered about the difference between the terms “post-growth” and “degrowth” and found this article: [Post-growth, degrowth, the doughnut and circular economy: a short guide](https://ontgroei.degrowth.net/post-growth-degrowth-the-doughnut-and-circular-economy-a-short-guide/) (originally posted at [planetamateur.com](https://planetamateur.com/2022/11/07/post-growth-degrowth-the-doughnut-and-circular-economy-a-short-guide/)). Here are some of my takeaways mixed with my own thoughts:

- The **circular economy** contrasts with the linear economy which extracts resources that are used and then thrown away. It tries to close loops (William McDonough’s term “cradle to cradle” comes to mind). This can be done by making waste into resource inputs, both at the larger scale of manufacturing (I think of an actual business that uses waste coffee grounds to grow edible mushrooms), to the smaller scale of things like [repair cafes](https://www.repaircafe.org/en/).
- The **doughnut** or doughnut economy is Kate Raworth’s [term](https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/), illustrated below, which ties together meeting human needs across a dozen categories (avoiding *shortfalls*) while staying within nine types of ecological limits (avoiding *overshoot*). <a title="DoughnutEconomics, CC BY-SA 4.0 &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Doughnut_(economic_model).jpg"><img width="512" alt="Doughnut (economic model)" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Doughnut_%28economic_model%29.jpg/512px-Doughnut_%28economic_model%29.jpg?20190108211232"></a>
- The article describes **post-growth** as an “approach without a toolkit.” Post-growth is the simple (and obvious) recognition that we can’t endlessly expand production and consumption on a finite planet. As I’ve been reading in more detail in [Kohei Saito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohei_Saito)’s  *[Slow Down](https://astrapublishinghouse.com/product/slow-down-9781662602368/)*, absolute decoupling (in which the economy grows while material consumption does not) is a nice concept to dream about, but is purely fantasy. Post-growth moves beyond seeking green technologies as the solution to our environmental problems – which while certainly useful will never be a sufficient solution – to calling into question growth itself.
