I've wondered about the difference between the terms "post-growth" and "degrowth" and found this article: [Post-growth, degrowth, the doughnut and circular economy: a short guide](https://ontgroei.degrowth.net/post-growth-degrowth-the-doughnut-and-circular-economy-a-short-guide/)(originally posted at [planetamateur.com](https://planetamateur.com/2022/11/07/post-growth-degrowth-the-doughnut-and-circular-economy-a-short-guide/)). Here are some of my takeaways mixed with my own thoughts:

- The **circular economy** contrasts with the linear economy which extracts resources that are used and then thrown away. It tries to close loops (William McDonough's term "cradle to cradle" comes to mind). This can be done by making waste into resource inputs, both at the larger scale of manufacturing (I think of an actual business that uses waste coffee grounds to grow edible mushrooms), to the smaller scale of things like [repair cafes](https://www.repaircafe.org/en/).
- The **doughnut** or doughnut economy is Kate Raworth's [term](https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/), illustrated below, which ties together meeting human needs across various categories (avoiding shortfalls) while staying within nine types of ecological limits (avoiding overshoot). <a title="DoughnutEconomics, CC BY-SA 4.0 &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Doughnut_(economic_model).jpg"><img width="512" alt="Doughnut (economic model)" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Doughnut_%28economic_model%29.jpg/512px-Doughnut_%28economic_model%29.jpg?20190108211232"></a>
