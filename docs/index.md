# Hello
I'm Seth and this is my digital garden and blog. My intention with this [digital garden](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/digital_garden/) is to have a place to put information I learn and to build and share knowledge. Unlike blog posts, the entries in this learning garden won't be polished pieces of writing. In fact, if I'm successful at using my garden, there will always be incomplete entries because it will always be a work in progress. Given how blogs can often be oriented towards marketing and promotion, 
Some topics I may cultivate in my garden include: degrowth, post-capitalism, the solidarity economy, permaculture, and technology.
